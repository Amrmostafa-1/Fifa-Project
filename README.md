# Fifa-Project
#### Fifa project function file is the last file with the functions and the validated numbers
#### Fifa project has is the main file the model is built on
#### Fifa project1 has a different model, with 1 change on the columns with the + values

#### we decided on removing some of the object columns that we thought are not needed for the model(or the info is conveyed in another column).
#### Decided to drop the 41 rows with the NaN values
#### Decided to fill the rest of the null values in composure with the median
#### Decided to drop the values after the + or - ( in file 1 the numbers after the + are added to the value)
